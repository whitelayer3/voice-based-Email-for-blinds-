# voice-based-Email-for-blinds-

Voice based email system helps visually challenged people
to access email services efficiently. It has been observed
that nearly about 60 percent total blind population across
the world is present in India. This system overcomes
difficulties faced by visually impaired people as well as
illiterate people. This will reduce the drawbacks of existing
system such as software load of using screen readers and
Automatic SpeechRecognizer(ASR). The system will be
guiding the user what needs to be performed for obtaining
desired results by prompting. Hence this reduces the user’s
load of remembering keyboard shortcuts and location of
keys. The user needs to follow the instructions given by the
system
